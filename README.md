# matrix-email-onboarding

A microservice to invite users to Matrix rooms (or spaces) via their email addresses, even before they might have a Matrix account.

Do you have a list of email addresses and Matrix rooms (or spaces) which you wish to invite them to? And you don't know their Matrix usernames or if they even have a Matrix account yet? This is for you. ‚ú®

- Comes with a CLI tool to send out emails üì® with a link (containing a secret token) for your user to click on
- Node.js server-side application to handle web requests to
  - (1) check a given secret onboarding token üîç and list the linked Matrix rooms or spaces
  - (2) let the user sign in ‚òëÔ∏è with their Matrix account and automatically join the given rooms or spaces
  - (3) (optionally) promote those newly joined users to become moderators or administrators üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

The only requirement for this is a Matrix user (or a bot) that
1. has the ability to access and send `dev.medienhaus.onboarding` events for all rooms that you want to invite users to, and
2. (optionally) has a power level at least as high as what you're trying to promote users to. (e.g. needs to be at least a moderator, if you want to make everyone a moderator)

## Configuration

Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`. Check the file's comments for more details.

<br>

## Running

```bash
npm start
```

You can make use the following environment variables to adjust your deployment:
- `PORT` Which port the service should run on (default: `3000`)
- `GLOBAL_PREFIX` If you are running the service in a certain subdirectory, e.g. behind a reverse-proxy (default: `/`)

<br>

## Scripts

**send-emails** - Sends out one email per unique email address in a given `.csv` file, and adds one `dev.medienhaus.onboarding` event per email address to each Matrix room/space containing an encrypted identifier unique to the recipient of the email.

  -b, --body <filePathEmailBody>                 (optional) path to .txt file containing the email body
```

The `.csv` file might look like this:
```csv

```

In your email body you can include the following placeholders which will be then replaced with its respective meaningful content:

- `<LINK>` The link that brings the user to the login form where they can login using a Matrix account to accept the invitation
- `<ROOMS>` A list of Matrix room names (separated by `\n`) the user is being invited to
